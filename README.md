<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

EscapeLink is a SOA app and needs both this front-end repo AND [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) ](https://github.com/escape-link/escapelink-be) (back-end) in order to be fully functioning.


### Overview
This project is built to satisfy the requirements of the Turing School of Software and Design's [Capstone Project](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/capstone/), where students come up with their own idea for an application and build it as a group project.

This application is designed for those who enjoy standard escape rooms, as well as those who appreciate puzzle and problem-solving games.

After being debriefed on the current mission, users have the option to either team up with others or embark on a solo adventure in EscapeLink. Once every team member is prepared to start the game, they are taken into the escape room, where they are presented with an intuitive and user-friendly interface that contains a handful of hidden puzzles.

## How to Use EscapeLink
No login or registration is needed with EscapeLink, and one can choose to play solo, or with a group. <br><br>
Upon arrival at the landing page, users will be prompted to choose an escape room. Once selected, users are taken to a page displaying details of the story, as well as the objective of that given escape room, and an option to start the game.<br><br>
Once the game is started, users are free to click on any objects on the page to prompt a corresponding puzzle, where they can enter the solution to the given puzzle.<br><br>
As soon as a user has solved the number of puzzles necessary to win a game, a victory message will be displayed, and a user will have the option to view the leaderboard for a given escape room.
